class RBasiliskUtils(RPackage):
    """Basilisk Installation Utilities.

    Implements utilities for installation of the basilisk package, primarily
    for creation of the underlying Conda instance. This allows us to avoid
    re-writing the same R code in both the configure script (for centrally
    administered R installations) and in the lazy installation mechanism (for
    distributed package binaries). It is highly unlikely that developers - or,
    heaven forbid, end-users! - will need to interact with this package
    directly; they should be using the basilisk package instead."""
